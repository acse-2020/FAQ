# Contributing to the ACSE FAQ

Please contribute to this FAQ by asking questions and offering answers. Everyone is encouraged to
participate in building a knowledge-base of information regarding the ACSE course and links to
useful external resources.

If this is the first time you have either used git or opened a pull request into a repository,
congratulations - you are learning a critical software carpentry skill! Do not worry about getting
things wrong or making mistakes if you are not experienced in this process. That is one of the 
reasons we use github for this FAQ, to give everyone a chance to work with pull requests in an
environment where support is proactively available and any confusions or mistakes are regarded as
learning opportunities.

## Adding a question

To add a question, create a branch, edit the FAQ to add your question, then open a draft pull
request from your branch into the 'main' branch.

The steps involved in creating a branch and opening a pull request are [documented in detail at docs.github.com]
(https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).

To edit the FAQ, you can either use the web interface at github.com to edit and commit changes
to files, or you can check out the FAQ repository to your local computer, make and commit your
changes, and push them back to github.com. 

You are encouraged to [use the git book as a reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if you 
opt for the second method. Whilst it involves more work for you, it is a very important skill
to become proficient at for the ACSE course, and this is an ideal opportunity to learn in a
supported environment.

When you ask your question you may or may not already have an answer to the question. If you do
not have an answer, and want others to help you find an answer, open your pull request as a draft
pull request. If you have both a question and a proposed answer that you are ready for reviewers
to read and comment on, open the pull request as ready for review.

## Answering open questions

Take a look at the [list of open pull requests](https://github.com/acse-2020/FAQ/pulls) to see which
questions have been asked and are awaiting answers.

To offer an answer to an open question, you are encouraged to either add comments to the
conversation of the relevant pull request, or open your own pull request into the branch containing
the question.

## Reviewing answers to a question

If you are listed as a reviewer for a question, either because you asked the question, had a similar
question, or were asked to comment on the answer, please add your voice to the comments and when you
are happy for the question to be committed to the main FAQ, add your approval.

## Modifying an existing answer

If you want to modify an existing answer, perhaps correcting a mistake or adding more information,
open a new pull request.
