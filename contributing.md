# Contributing to the ACSE FAQ

Please contribute to this FAQ by asking questions and offering answers. Everyone is encouraged to
participate in building a knowledge-base of information regarding the ACSE course and links to
useful external resources.

If this is the first time you have either used git or opened a pull request into a repository,
congratulations - you are learning a critical software carpentry skill! Do not worry about getting
things wrong or making mistakes if you are not experienced in this process. That is one of the 
reasons we use github for this FAQ, to give everyone a chance to work with pull requests in an
environment where support is proactively available and any confusions or mistakes are regarded as
learning opportunities.

Here's a useful guide on [how to fork a repository and manage a pull request](https://linuxhint.com/pull_request_github/).

You are encouraged to [use the git book as a reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## Asking a question

### Forking the FAQ repository

To ask a question, you will need to have a base branch to open a pull request from. 

## Answering open questions

To offer an answer to an open question, you are encouraged to either add comments to the
conversation of the relevant pull request, or open your own pull request into the branch containing
the question.

## Reviewing answers to a question

If you are listed as a reviewer for a question, either because you asked the question, had a similar
question, or were asked to comment on the answer, please add your voice to the comments and when you
are happy for the question to be committed to the main FAQ, add your approval.
