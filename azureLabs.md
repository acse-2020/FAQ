# Azure Labs

## General questions

### What is Azure Labs?

See [the introduction to Azure Labs page](https://acse-2020.github.io/introduction/labs/intro.html).

## Registration questions

### I haven't received and invitation to a lab that I need to access

If you don't think you've been added to the lab, contact [Tim Greaves](mailto:tim.greaves@imperial.ac.uk),
supplying details of your Imperial College username.

If you know you are on the access list but have lost your invitation, you can either contact
[Tim Greaves](mailto:tim.greaves@imperial.ac.uk) to request a new invitation, or ask anyone
who has the registration link to pass it on to you - all users register using the same link,
and are authenticated by their college account.

### Do I register with my Imperial College username or my Github username?

You need to use your Imperial College username to register with Azure Labs

### Azure Labs is asking for my Imperial College login details - is this OK?

Yes, all Imperial College authentication is delegated to Microsoft, who also manage Azure,
so it is both expected and secure to log in using your Imperial College account. If you want
to double check the security, verify you are using https and have a valid certificate back
from login.microsoftonline.com

## Quota questions

### Why do I only have limited hours for Azure Labs access?

Azure Labs is a cloud service, charged on a subscription basis rather than as a flat-fee
as a physical computer laboratory would be. It is assumed that students will have good
self-management skills and work efficiently, so to contain costs the labs quota is set at
a level which should allow all course work to be completed, with some allowance for delays.

Quotas are also set to teach good practise with cloud resources. Many students on the course
will not have backgrounds in cloud computing and learning about the costs and economic risks
of cloud use in a safe, training environment where mistakes have minimal consequences is a
very good preparation for going into industry where a mistake could incur very serious financial
costs.

### I've run out of quota. How do I request more?

Contact the module tutors with a request for more hours to be allocated to your account. You
should request a specific number of hours, details of why you need additional hours, and some
accounting of what you have used your initial quota for.

### I forgot to shut down my labs machine and ran down my hours by mistake. What should I say?

If you have run out of hours due to a mistake, you are encouraged to report that directly.
Everyone has made mistakes when starting out with cloud use, and you will not be the only one
on the course to make such a mistake. By discussing what went wrong you will be helping others
around you to learn, and building an environment of respect and collaboration. Everyone gains
from teamwork and open discussion.
