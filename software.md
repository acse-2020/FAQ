# FAQs regarding software for the ACSE course

Software installs for ACSE students are [documented in detail here](https://acse-2020.github.io/introduction/software/intro.html).
Questions relating to errors or significant omissions in that file can be raised as questions here but are likely to be resolved
as bug-fixes on the software intro page.

This FAQ is primarily for questions relating to installs on non-standard platforms, corner-case errors, and questions relating to
the post-install environment.
