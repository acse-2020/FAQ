# Git

Most questions relating to git use are answered in detail in
[the git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). This FAQ can
be used to link into the book in answer to specific questions, 
but is primarily intended to answer more ACSE course specific
questions around git use and git interaction with other course
software.

## My local git repository keeps changing unexpectedly

Are you working with your local repository inside a folder
managed by OneDrive or another cloud storage system which
applies changes automatically? If so, try checking out the
repository somewhere else and see if it fixes the problem.

In general there is no need to have git repositories under
cloud management - if you are committing and pushing regularly,
git's distributed nature should be more than sufficient backup.
